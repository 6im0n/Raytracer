## **ℹ️ About**
The Raytracer project undertaken in the Second year at [{Epitech}](https://www.epitech.eu/) is designed to allow students to put into practice fundamental programming concepts of oriented object in C and to introduce to the development of raytracer program concept

### **📃 Description**

Raytracer is a **Rendering algorithm**: 
A raytracer is a 3D rendering algorithm, very different from the rendering algorithms used in the video game industry. It's a rendering method called "ray tracing" that works by calculating intersections. It's a very expensive method in terms of computing power, which makes it unusable for real-time rendering. However, it is a rendering method that comes as close as possible to photo-realistic rendering, making it the method of choice for rendering special effects in cinema, for example.

> [!CAUTION]
> It is **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** to refer to a graphics library explicitly in your main program. Only your dynamic libraries can do so. This also applies to your games.


> [!NOTE]
> These dynamic libraries can be seen as plug-ins providing various capabilities to your main program. In **NO CASE** must graphics libraries influence the game logic. Game libraries must not contain any information about screen rendering or low-level events.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You MUST **NOT** differentiate your libraries. Each of your libraries MUST be handled in a generic and uniform manner. Keep genericity!
