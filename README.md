## **ℹ️ About**
The Raytracer project undertaken in the Second year at [{Epitech}](https://www.epitech.eu/) is designed to allow students to put into practice fundamental programming concepts of oriented object in C and to introduce to the development of raytracer program concept

### **📃 Description**

Raytracer is a **Rendering algorithm**: 
A raytracer is a 3D rendering algorithm, very different from the rendering algorithms used in the video game industry. It's a rendering method called "ray tracing" that works by calculating intersections. It's a very expensive method in terms of computing power, which makes it unusable for real-time rendering. However, it is a rendering method that comes as close as possible to photo-realistic rendering by simulating the inverse path of light, making it the method of choice for rendering special effects in cinema, for example. 

Our goal is to create a program able to generate an image from a file describing the scene.

### ⚠️ MUST
```
Your raytracer must support the following features:
- Primitives:
    • Sphere
    • Plane
- Transformations:
    • Translation
- Light:
    • Directional light
    • Ambient light
- Material:
    • Flat color
- Scene configuration:
    • Add primitives to scene
    • Set up lighting
    • Set up camera
- Interface:
    • No GUI, output to a PPM file
```

### 📌 SHOULD
```
Once the previous features are working properly, you should add the following ones:
• Primitives:
    • Cylinder
    • Cone
• Transformation:
    • Rotations
• Light:
    • Drop shadows
```

> [!NOTE]
> An infinite amount of bonuses are possible. Feel free to add as many features as you  want as long as the mandatory (must and should) features are completed.
